## About Me
#### I am 35 years old. I am a reliable person, honest, responsive, hardy, hardworking. I am determined to go through The Rolling Scopes School and become a professional developer with diligence. I already had experience in software development while working at 1C, but for some reason I left the company and decided to do business. The constant desire to create something new led me to the decision to learn front-end development and develop professionally in this interesting direction.

## Code Example
 *The challenge is to write a function that takes a string and returns a new string with all the vowels removed.*
```
 function disemvowel(str) {
      const ALPHABET = 'AaEeIiOoUu';
      let newMas = str;
      let returnMas = '';
      let flag = false;

      for (let i = 0; i < newMas.length; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < ALPHABET.length; j++) {
          if (newMas[i] === ALPHABET[j]) {
            flag = true;
          }
        }
        if (!flag) {
          returnMas = returnMas + newMas[i];
        }
        flag = false;
      }
      return returnMas;
    }
```
